Build AI Applications Designed for Change.

## Key Value

### Seamless Interchangeability

Embrace model iterations without refactoring code. Our framework treats every AI capability—such as data chunking, summarization, and vectorization—as an interchangeable "processor" When a better or more cost-effective model emerges, simply change one line in the configuration file to instantly upgrade your technology, optimize cost, and improve performance.

### Graceful Composability & Abstraction

Build complex workflows like stacking LEGO bricks. Our framework lets you encapsulate any complex processing logic—like "PDF to clean Markdown"—into a reusable sub-pipeline. This keeps your main workflow remarkably concise and clear, while giving you unlimited extensibility to handle growing business complexity.
